(** * Rely/Guarantee Reasoning *)

(* In this problem set we will reason about concurrent programs using a program
 * logic called rely-guarantee program logic.  In this logic, in addition to
 * precondition and postcondition, each Hoare triple also contains a "rely",
 * which specifies how the environment (e.g. other threads) can interfere and
 * change the state at any point; and a "guarantee", which specifies how
 * *any piece of* this program can change the state (so the Hoare triple should
 * really be called "Hoare quintuple").  The name "rely-guarantee" comes from
 * the interpretation "I rely on the environment to interfere in a way
 * compatible with the rely condition, and I guarantee that I will make no
 * atomic state change not allowed by the guarantee condition".  It is important
 * that the guarantee condition is imposed on all atomic state changes, because
 * any piece of a program can be run in a burst of execution by the scheduler,
 * and its effect is interference from other threads' points of view.  By
 * decomposing a multi-thread program into threads with rely/guarantee acting as
 * their interface, we achieve modular, thread-local reasoning. *)

(** ** Similar language definition as before, except that we group [Read] and
     * [Write] into a syntax category called [Atomic] operations. *)
