(** Data Abstraction via Contextual Equivalence *)

(* Here's a typical student reaction to the content on type systems from a
 * course like this one:
 *   "Yeah, it's good to prove that programs don't crash, but it's so much more
 *   exciting to prove that programs actually return correct answers, and we've
 *   seen plenty of techniques for that already (and will see more in the rest
 *   of the course).  Can we get this type-system stuff over with so we can move
 *   on to the _important_ stuff?"
 *
 * However, it turns out that type systems are very handy for formalizing a very
 * thorough kind of correctness condition for code libraries!  In particular,
 * let's return to _abstract data types_, which we first studied in Pset 2,
 * where we define a formal _interface_ for a data structure and prove that some
 * _implementation_ satisfies the interface.  Recall that Pset 2 asked you to
 * prove a selection of algebraic laws for some implementation.  But how do we
 * know that we picked the right set of laws?  What if we could show that the 
 * laws were somehow _complete_ for the interface, prescribing _all possible
 * behaviors_ of the abstract data type?
 *
 * The concept of _contextual equivalence_ formalizes that idea in a general
 * way.  Say we have a simple _reference implementation_ of an abstract data
 * type, and we also have a more fancy, optimized implementation.  Consider all
 * possible _client code_ that imports a library for this data structure.  It
 * doesn't known which of the two it will be linked with; it must work for both.
 * The two libraries are _contextually equivalent_ if no client code can tell
 * them apart, so, say, the client code computes the same answer regardless.
 *
 * It is crucial to formalize the library interface with a type, so that we can
 * constraint which client programs are valid.  That's exactly what we do in
 * this pset, in addition to introducing a method for proving contextual
 * equivalence. *)


(** * Language syntax, semantics, and typing *)

(* Here's our base language, which only uses features familiar from the last
 * pset and class examples. *)

Inductive exp  :=
(* First, the basic STLC ingredients *)
| Var (x : var)
| Abs (x : var) (e1 : exp)
| App (e1 e2 : exp)
(* Constants and basic arithmetic *)
| Const (n : nat)
| Add (e1 e2 : exp)
| Sub (e1 e2 : exp)
(* And pairs; they're less general than tuples in the previous problem set. *)
| Pair (e1 e2 : exp)
| Fst (e : exp)
| Snd (e : exp).

Inductive value : exp -> Prop :=
| VAbs : forall x e1, value (Abs x e1)
| VConst : forall n, value (Const n)
| VPair : forall e1 e2, value e1 -> value e2 -> value (Pair e1 e2).

Hint Constructors value.
Hint Extern 1 (value _) => constructor.

(* Syntax of types *)
Inductive type :=
| Nat
| Fun (dom ran : type)
| Prod (t1 t2 : type)
(* We have a new type, called [AbsT], representing the abstract type. When
 * implementing a certain data structure, we don't want to expose how it is
 * implemented by giving actual types of the implementation.  Instead, we just
 * claim that the implementation satisfies an abstract type.  Clients use it
 * without knowing the actual implementation, while the implementer should check
 * the type without any abstraction. *)
| AbsT.

(* Fancy notations *)

(** A target ADT: simple counters *)
(* We want to prove that two simple counter implementations are
 * _contextually equivalent_, using a logical relation.  Below we can see two
 * implementations: [counter_impl1] is just using a single number to count.
 * Note that the counter exposes two distinct methods for incrementing its
 * value.  They should do the same work from the perspective of the external
 * world.  [counter_impl2] makes each increment method increment a different
 * private number, storing the two numbers within a pair. *)

Definition counter_type : type :=
  (AbsT ^*^ (* The internal counter value is abstracted; clients cannot use this
             * value.  In Java terms, think of this type part as a private
             * field. *)
  (AbsT --> Nat ^*^  (* Method to get the actual counter value *)
  (AbsT --> AbsT ^*^ (* Method to increase the counter value *)
   AbsT --> AbsT))). (* Second method to increase the counter value *)

(* Here's the simple reference implementation. *)
Definition counter_val1 := Const 0.
Definition counter_get1 := \"x", "x".
Definition counter_inc11 := \"x", "x" ^+^ 1.
Definition counter_inc21 := \"x", "x" ^+^ 1.
Definition counter_impl1 :=
  @(counter_val1, @(counter_get1, @(counter_inc11, counter_inc21))).

(* And here's the more convoluted two-counter version. *)
Definition counter_val2 := @(0, 0).
Definition counter_get2 := \"xy", (fst "xy") ^+^ (snd "xy").
Definition counter_inc12 := \"xy", @( (fst "xy") ^+^ 1, snd "xy" ).
Definition counter_inc22 := \"xy", @( fst "xy", (snd "xy") ^+^ 1 ).
Definition counter_impl2 :=
  @(counter_val2, @(counter_get2, @(counter_inc12, counter_inc22))).

(* Intuitively, client code can't distinguish these two versions, if it doesn't
 * know how the abstract type is implemented.  In this pset, we will work up to
 * proving that property for this example, in the process developing formal
 * machinery also applicable to many related examples.  (And all of this
 * generalizes to fancier languages with more expressive typing, though the
 * details are out of scope for the assignment.) *)

(* Some routine definitions again! They should should now be very familiar, so
 * it's safe for you to skim through quickly. But it is recommended to pay
 * attention to the typing rules, since now there is a new concept with
 * _abstract types_. *)
